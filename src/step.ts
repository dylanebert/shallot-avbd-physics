//
//   aabb       — each body's oriented-box world-AABB → the broadphase prims
//   broadphase — writes each live body's per-eid FIXED block `pairList[eid·PAIRS_PER_BODY + k]` directly
//                (nearest-K + static-pin, unused slots INVALID). Two regimes keyed on the frame-stale live

//                candidate/emit WGSL keeps the blocks identical, so warmstart carries across a flip.
//   collide    — box-box SAT (collide.ts) per per-eid pair slot; writes/warmstarts the manifold IN PLACE
//                in the persistent `pairContacts` (the (a,b)+feature key carries λ/k — no hash, no separate store)
//   inertial   — per-body inertial target + adaptive warmstart reposition (Eq. 2 + VBD)
//   colorize   — incremental-greedy body coloring, capped at maxColors (folds past it); publishes the
//                used-color count to `colorCount` for the readback-bounded color loop (Phase 4.9 Lever 1).
//                In the small-N regime the CSR build + coloring run as ONE fused single-WG dispatch
//                (csrColorSmallWgsl — C1.1); the multi-WG passes are the at-scale regime
//   primal     — colored Gauss-Seidel: `boundColors`-many color-passes/iter (min(maxColors, usedColors +
//                COLOR_MARGIN), the frame-stale readback count), each dispatched DIRECT off the
//                frame-stale live count + BODY_MARGIN (`boundBodies`, rung 0), force stamp + 6×6 LDLᵀ
//   dual       — λ ← F + conditional penalty ramp + friction stick (manifold.ts updateDual), in place in
//                pairContacts so next frame's collide warmstarts off it
//   velocity   — BDF1 velocity recovery
//
// The contact force law (Taylor C, cone-clamped F, the 6×6 Jacobian/Hessian stamp) is one shared
// `contactForce` (CONTACT_FORCE_WGSL) the primal and dual both read — the reference inlines it in
// both `updatePrimal` and `updateDual`. The collide carries λ/k across frames in the persistent
// `pairContacts` store (the GPU reconstruction of the reference's force-list manifold persistence,
// Eq. 19) — no cache pass, no separate warmCache (the webphysics persistent per-pair-slot model,
// Phase 4.9 sized per-active-pair: storage + the per-pair slot contract live in physics.md "Storage").
// The GPU runs warmstart-only; the CPU oracle (tests/solver.ts) keeps the penalty/dual phase-ladder
// layers for the build-up oracle tests.
//
// Validated against the f64 oracle in the gym `pile` scenario (the canonical real-GPU + perf
// home): free-fall = closed form, resting box → margin, and the single-step-exact gate (GPU contacts
// fed to the oracle, one step each, compared).
//
// Storage is eid-indexed over `capacity` (`bodies[col*eidCap + eid]`), persistent across frames — a
// body's solver state lives at its eid slot and survives spawn/despawn (no dense scaffold, no sim-reset).
// The GPU `pack` (an eid-SORTED multi-workgroup count→scan→scatter over the Body membership bitset,
// C1.3) writes the dense→eid map (`eids[0]` = live count, `eids[1+d]` = the d-th live eid) +
// one-time-seeds a newly-spawned body's slot from its authored `Body` slabs. The warmstart slot is the
// owner eid's FIXED per-body block (`eid·PAIRS_PER_BODY + k`), so it's stable across frames unless the
// owner's own candidate set flickers (local fragility — Phase 4.9 robustness, avbd.md). Body passes
// dispatch indirect off the live count (the primal/commit color loop direct off its frame-stale readback,
// rung 0); the per-eid-block passes (collide / dual / CSR) dispatch indirect off `pairArgs`
// (= liveCount · PAIRS_PER_BODY lanes). f32 throughout (rebuild's f32-first;

// ── coloring: incremental-greedy body coloring (the Phase-4 crux, validated standalone) ──
// Ported from webphysics `greedyBodyColorsShader`: one thread per body, no atomics. Each body reads a
// stable prior-frame snapshot of every body's color (`colorScratch`, seeded by a copy before this pass),
// builds a 32-wide u32 mask of the colors its *higher-id dynamic neighbors* held last frame, and picks
// the lowest color not in that mask — keeping its own prior color when still free (the incremental
// reuse that makes the coloring settle across frames). The higher-id symmetry break (avoid only
// neighbors with `other > bid`) is what removes the atomics: each undirected contact edge is resolved
// by its lower-id endpoint, against the higher-id endpoint's prior color. Static neighbors (mass ≤ 0)
// are never solved, so they impose no scheduling constraint and are skipped; a static body itself is
// left uncolored (0xffffffff — the primal early-returns on mass before reading its color).
//
// The cap (`params.maxColors`) is separate from the 32-wide mask (avbd.md — two
// numbers): a body that finds no free color within the cap folds to `bid % maxColors`, degrading that
// pair to Jacobi for the step (a soft-contact conflict the iterative primal tolerates — the invariant
// is a low *measured* conflict rate, not zero). The neighbor scan reads the body's CSR contact list
// (csrList[csr[bid] .. +csr[eidCap+bid]]), not every contact — the same O(valence) read the primal
// does. Deterministic integer logic; the CPU reference is tests/coloring.ts (the executable

// storage round trip (CSR → records → both bodies' poses), paid the same at a dispatch boundary as at an
// in-kernel storageBarrier — which is why the plain single-WG megakernel measured nothing (physics.md
// "Dispatch count", refuted 2026-06-10). This kernel removes the round trip itself: every live body's
// pose lives in workgroup memory across the loop (Bullet 3 solveContact.cl solves from __local batches),
// so a color phase's dependent chain is a workgroupBarrier on LDS. Everything else a solve reads (CSR,
// contact records, inertial targets, mass) is loop-constant or once-per-iteration storage traffic.
//
// Capacity: pos (3 split f32 columns) + quat (vec4) = 28 B/body → LDS_CAP = 512 inside the 16 KB
// workgroup-memory floor. Contacts/joints address bodies by EID, so an eid → dense map (denseMap,
// rebound over the solveOut buffer — unused by this path, ≥ 4·eidCap bytes) routes bPos/bQuat into the
// LDS slot; a live body past LDS_CAP (a spawn burst inside the regime gate's 1-2 frame staleness — the
// BODY_MARGIN class) falls back to its storage pose and skips its solve for one frame, which the next
// readback catches. The per-color double-buffer (a folded same-color pair must be a clean Jacobi) stages
// each lane's ≤2 solved poses in registers and commits them after a barrier; the dual + joint dual
// stride their slots under a storageBarrier per iteration (records are storage-resident — far too large
// for LDS, and touched once per iteration, not per color). The color count is computed in-kernel
// (atomicMax over the live dynamics' colors), fresher than the looped path's readback bound and one
// binding cheaper — the kernel is exactly AT the 10-storage-buffer floor.
// solve-lds's own I/O: `colors`/`eids` (the looped path's own bindings) + `denseMap`, the eid → LDS-slot
// map REBOUND over the `solveOut` scratch (unused by this path — 2·eidCap vec4s ≥ the eidCap u32s the map
// needs; the kernel sits exactly at the 10-storage floor, so the map can't be a new buffer without
// evicting one). `csr`/`csrList`/`constraintCsr`/`constraintList` need no binding here — `solvePose`

// buffer: `csr[eidCap+eid]` = contacts per body, `csr[eid]` = the start of its slice in `csrList`,
// `csrList[off .. off+count]` the MANIFOLD-RECORD indices touching that body (the primal reads `cc(csrList[k])`).
// Offsets + counts share one binding (Phase 4.9) so the maxed primal/coloring passes bind one slot, not two.
// Each active record lands in BOTH its bodies' slices, so a body reads every contact it's in (the primal's
// `contactContrib` picks the body's Jacobian). This is the O(count·contacts) → O(valence) collapse. count +
// scatter run one thread per pair SLOT (looping the slot's CONTACTS_PER_PAIR records, skipping inactive), so
// they scan only the live blocks; the scan (resetting count to the scatter cursor) is the single-workgroup
// parallel prefix sum.

// ── pack: GPU membership-scan → the dense→eid map (the Part-pack firehose) ──
// One lane per eid over scene capacity, gated on the Body membership bit (the mirror the Part pack
// reads). FULLY GPU — no CPU entity iteration, not even a marker query. Each live eid does two things:
//   • PACK — a deterministic eid-sorted compaction into `eids` (`eids[0]` = the live count, `eids[1+d]`
//     = the d-th live eid — the dense→eid map every body pass reads as `i = eids[1+gid.x]`). Sorted
//     order keeps a per-body pair block's slot stable across frames (the persistent warmstart's
//     precondition); an atomic-append (arbitrary order) would shuffle them every frame.
//   • SEED (one-time) — a GPU `seeded` flag (per eid) gates the copy of the authored Body slabs
//     (pos/quat/half/mass/friction, GPU-mirrored via slab.gpu) into `bodies[*][eid]` + the moment derive
//     + velocity zero, then sets the flag. Existing bodies' slots are untouched (a mid-sim spawn never
//     disturbs the settled pile). A non-member eid resets its flag, so a recycled eid re-seeds.
// `eidCap`/`maxBodies`/`gen`/`mask` are baked (construction constants — no step uniform binding needed).
// `packScan` bounds `eids[0]` to the pool + publishes it to the BVH + the dispatch args; overflow drops
// the map write loudly.
//
// The compaction is MULTI-WORKGROUP (C1.3): count → scan → scatter over PACK_WG-eid chunks, one lane per
// eid. The prior single-WG form had each lane serially walk eidCap/PACK_WG eids — an O(capacity) span on
// one SM (~130 µs/frame at the default 65536 capacity, regardless of live count). Three dispatches cost
// ~2 extra phase boundaries (~2 µs); the serial walk they delete cost two orders more. packCount also
// carries the one-time seed/reset (per-eid work, parallel). packScan is a single small WG over the
// per-workgroup sums (numWgs = capacity/PACK_WG elements); packScatter recomputes each workgroup's local
// membership prefix (cheaper than storing per-lane bases) and writes the sorted slots — chunks are
// disjoint and eid-ordered, so the output is bit-identical to the single-WG form.

     * The colored primal is `iterations × maxColors` primal+commit pairs — `colorize` (ahead of the
     * primal) caps the colors at `maxColors`, so the dispatch count is bounded by the cap, not the body
     * count (physics.md "Dispatch count is the binding cost"; WebGPU's dominant cost is the per-dispatch
     * CPU encode, ~5.9µs all-in on desktop D3D12, multiples higher on the Deck — not the GPU solve span).
     * Four levers applied here: the cap bounds the dispatch count; the current color rides a dynamic
     * uniform offset (no per-color `advanceColor` dispatch); all colors of an iteration share one compute
     * pass (consecutive same-pass dispatches with a write→read hazard are ordered by the implementation's
     * barrier — the single-step gate confirms); the color loop dispatches direct off the frame-stale live
     * count (`boundBodies`, rung 0 — an indirect dispatch's injected validation costs ≈ 2× a direct one). The solve is **double-buffered** (Phase 4.5 Stage B, the
     * grounded method — paper Algorithm 1, webphysics `commitBodySolveKernel`, oracle `primalColored`):
     * the primal solves a color into the `solveOut` scratch reading the committed `bodies`, then a commit
     * dispatch applies `solveOut` → `bodies` for that color, so a same-color contact pair is a clean
     * Jacobi (both read the color-start pose), not an order-dependent write-in-place race. The commit
     * roughly doubles the primal-related dispatches — the price of a reference-grounded colored commit.
     *
     * One dual dispatch follows each iteration's primal pass (λ ← F + the penalty ramp), reading the
     * post-primal pose written by the colors above it.
     *
     * The collide reads + rewrites each pair slot's records in `pairContacts` (the persistent store) in
     * place, carrying last frame's λ/k; the dual writes the final λ/k back to the same records. No cache
     * pass — the store IS this frame's contacts. A separated pair's slot is cleared by the collide (cold
     * next frame); `cold()` (the gates, between scenes) clears the whole store before the collide.
     *
     * No CPU count: the body passes dispatch over the body pool and early-out past `eids[0]` (the
     * GPU-resident live count the pack wrote); an empty scene is all-early-out, harmless.
