// the headless lavapipe physics gate — the AVBD stack builds, steps, and reads back on the
// software adapter `bun test` preloads, at an entity capacity its contact store fits under.
//
// What this proves (and what it deliberately does not): the physics build pipeline compiles and
// the solver executes on a real WebGPU device headlessly, and `probeBuffer` reads a body's
// solver-owned pose back with finite values — the de-risking probe S1 of the
// shallot-headless-verifiability unit. It is NOT a correctness oracle: lavapipe is explicitly
// non-conformant/testing-only, and per-step math parity against the f64 CPU oracle stays in
// `*.oracle.ts` (CPU) + the gym `pile` scenario (real GPU). The assertions here are the
// closed-form rung only — finite poses, a falling body strictly below its authored start after
// a few fixed ticks (closed-form gravity direction, avbd.md "Gate where it's deterministic"
// rung 1 — no chaos accumulates in five ticks), and a grounded character at its closed-form
// rest height — never a number read back and tuned to.
//
// Why capacity 8192: the contact store sizes off the entity capacity (`eidCap × 3584 B`:
// PAIRS_PER_BODY 8 × CONTACTS_PER_PAIR 4 × CONTACT_VEC4 7 × 16 B per eid), and lavapipe's real
// adapter ceiling is the spec-default `maxStorageBufferBindingSize` of 128 MiB (measured, Mesa
// 25.3.4). 8192 × 3584 B ≈ 28 MiB fits with 4.5× headroom; the engine default 65536 (~235 MiB)
// does not — that, not a device capability, is what kept physics out of the headless roster
// (the exclusion comment this tier deleted from `conformance-roster.ts`). `build({ capacity })`
// is fixed at app construction (`engine/app`).
//
// Placement: `.oracle.ts`, decided by the measured per-arm wall clock against the 5000 ms
// per-file cap (`tests/test-cap.ts`): cold (first run in a fresh checkout, no adapter shader
// cache) physics 1652 ms, character 95 ms, player 150 ms, 2.30 s for the file — 54% headroom
// under the cap, below the ~60% headroom bar that earns a `.test.ts` suffix. Warm (adapter shader cache
// present) the file runs ~0.7 s, but the placement decision must hold for the cold worst
// case, so it stays a named oracle. Re-run numbers are expected to vary with the host
// (lavapipe is CPU-executed). Run by path from the shallot root:
// `bun test ./tests/headless.oracle.ts`.
//
// Trigger cone (this named oracle's header is its registry): the transitive
// import cone of this file's arms — `src/**` (plugin + PhysicsStep),
// `src/standard/physics/**` (substrate), `src/standard/character/**` + `src/standard/player/**`
// (sweep arms), `src/standard/{slab,mirror,input,render,transforms}/**` (declared dependencies
// the arms build with), and `src/engine/runtime/probe.ts` (the readback seam). Re-derive from
// the imports below if it drifts.
//
// The readback seam is the existing `probeBuffer` (`engine/runtime/probe.ts`) — it owns the
// encoder/submit/staging/mapAsync chain and validates usage + alignment, so this test adds zero
// plumbing. `Avbd.step.bodies` is the solver's SoA cols-buffer (`bodies[col * eidCap + eid]`,
// `COPY_SRC` by construction), and the B_* column indices are imported from `step.ts` so the
// probe offsets cannot drift from the solver's own layout.
