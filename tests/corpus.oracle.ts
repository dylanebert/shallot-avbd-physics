// The Phase-4.6 topology stability corpus, oracle tier.
// The gym `pile` scenario is one jittered grid; this is the band-gated corpus across distinct
// topologies (corpus.ts) so stability problems have somewhere to surface. Here it runs through the
// f64 oracle — the reference for what "stable" looks like: every scene settles, energy never
// exceeds the drop supremum, penetration converges to the margin rest, nothing tunnels. The gym
// `pile` scenario runs the identical scenes + band; a scene steady here but wobbling there is a
// GPU bug, not a band that's wrong (avbd.md "the oracle is not the suspect").
//
// The band is the gate-ladder's statistical band, never a long-horizon
// trajectory match — chaotic settling can't bit-match. Bounds are derived (corpus.ts BAND_*) and
// the oracle sits an order inside each (measured values in-line).
