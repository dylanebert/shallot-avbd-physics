// on, testable now without any keying scheme: perturb a resting face contact by a sub-box ε and
// assert each *surviving* contact (matched by world position) keeps its feature key.
//
// The precondition holds for an INTERIOR contact — a box resting on a larger ground, the realistic
// physics case, where the incident (box) face is fully inside the reference (ground) face, so a

// corner sits ON a clip boundary (two equal boxes) *does* reorder under perturbation — the SAT is
// faithful there to the C++ reference, which simply cold-starts that contact (penalty→MIN, λ→0); it
// re-converges in a few iters, no crash. So the warmstart keying must tolerate key loss at boundaries
// (graceful cold-start), and this gate guards the interior case it can actually rely on.
