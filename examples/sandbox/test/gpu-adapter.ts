// Shared real-GPU adapter probe: every sandbox Playwright spec needs the same "skip on a software
// adapter" check before waiting on the app's boot hook — shared across this project's specs via this
// module. Not itself a `*.playwright.ts`, so Playwright's own testMatch never picks it up as a test file.

// Software rasterizers by the name they report in `GPUAdapterInfo`: Chromium's SwiftShader, Mesa's two,
// and D3D's WARP. Deliberately a name list rather than a capability probe — SwiftShader clears shallot's
// whole base floor (all three `BASE_FEATURES` plus 10 storage buffers per stage, measured on the retired WSL seat
// 2026-08-10), so nothing about the floor distinguishes it, and it is only the *execution* that dies.
// Bias narrow: an unlisted software adapter re-crashes loudly, while an over-broad pattern would skip this
// gate on real hardware and report green having tested nothing.
